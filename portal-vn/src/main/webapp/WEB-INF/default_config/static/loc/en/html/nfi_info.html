							The forest cover map 1995 was produced originally under the NFIMAP Cycle I through visual interpretation of printed Landsat MSS and Landsat TM images collected between 1991 and 1995. It was further improved by complementary Landsat and Aster images, inconsistencies correction and forest categories harmonization to 12 forest and 5 non-forest classes, with funding from JICA, Finland and MARD, and handed over to VNFOREST. 
							<br /><br />The forest cover map 2000 was produced under NFIMAP Cycle II through visual interpretation of printed Landsat ETM+ and SPOT 4 images collected between 1996 and 2000. It was further improved by complementary Landsat and Aster images, inconsistencies correction and forest categories harmonization to 12 forest and 5 non-forest classes, with funding from JICA, Finland and MARD, and handed over to VNFOREST. 
							<br /><br />The forest cover map 2005 was produced under NFIMAP Cycle III, applying digital classification of Landsat ETM+. Inconsistencies were corrected and forest categories harmonized to 12 forest and 5 non-forest classes, with funding from JICA, Finland and MARD, and handed over to VNFOREST. 
							<br /><br />The forest cover map 2010 was produced under NFIMAP Cycle IV, applying visual interpretation of digital SPOT 5 images. The forest categories have been harmonized to 12 forest and 5 non-forest classes, with funding from JICA and MARD, and handed over to VNFOREST.

						<td class="col-md-9 col-sm-10">The maps used for the FRL calculations were the shapefiles from which these raster files were derived (function Rasterize in QGIS). Therefore recalculating the FRL based on these maps could lead to differences with the official FRL of about 10% due to the rasterizing process. The original shapefiles are stored at FIPI.</td>
