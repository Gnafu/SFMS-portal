						<td class="col-md-9 col-sm-10">The forest cover map 1995 was produced initially under the NFIMAP Cycle I through visual interpretation of printed Landsat MSS and Landsat TM images collected between 1991 and 1995. 
						It was further improved by complementary Landsat and Aster images, inconsistencies correction and forest categories harmonisation to 12 forest and 5 non-forest classes. 
						<br/><br/>The forest cover map 2000 was produced under NFIMAP Cycle II through visual interpretation of printed Landsat ETM+ and SPOT 4 images collected between 1996 and 2000. 
						It was further improved by complementary Landsat and Aster images, inconsistencies correction and forest categories harmonisation to 12 forest and 5 non-forest classes. 
						<br/><br/>
						The forest cover map 2005 was produced under NFIMAP Cycle III, applying digital classification of Landsat ETM+. Inconsistencies were corrected and forest categories harmonised to 12 forest and 5 non-forest classes. 
						<br/>
						<br/>
The forest cover map 2010 was produced under NFIMAP Cycle IV, applying visual interpretation of digital SPOT 5 images. The forest categories have been harmonized to 12 forest and 5 non-forest classes. 
						<br/>
						<br/>
The forest cover map 2015 (on-going process) is based on automatized and visual interpretation of SPOT 5 satellite images collected between 2012 and 2016, mainly at provincial level. The forest categories have been harmonized to 12 forest and 5 non-forest classes.
