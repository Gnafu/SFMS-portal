							The activities are defined as follows:

							<li><b>Reducing emissions from deforestation ("Deforestation")</b>: Activity of conversion of forests to non-forest land, i.e. forest cover changes from category 1-12 to 13-17 in the matrix.</li>
							<li><b>Reducing emissions from forest degradation ("Degradation")</b>: Activity resulting in a downward shift in terms of carbon stock between forest types, including Evergreen broadleaf forest volume-based sub-types of "rich, medium, and poor" (based on the average standing volume per ha) and other forest types (deciduous, bamboos etc.), i.e. positive changes between the categories 1-12.</li>
							<li><b>Enhancement of forest carbon stocks from reforestation ("Reforestation")</b>: Activity of land use change from non-forest land to forest land, changes form the categories 13-17 to 1-12.</li>
							<li><b>Enhancement of forest carbon stocks from forest restoration ("Restoration")</b>: Activity resulting in upward shift of carbon stock between forest types, including Evergreen broadleaf forest volume-based sub-types of "rich, medium, and poor" (based on the average standing volume per ha) and other forest types (deciduous, bamboos etc.), i.e. negative changes between the categories 1-12.</li>
