						The carbon stock estimates are developed using from tree level data collected through the NFIMAP Cycle IV (2006-2010) of MARD, implemented by FIPI. 
						<br/>Measurements were taken in 2,100 plots based on a systematic sampling design nationwide. 
						Tree diameter at breast height (DBH) was measured for all trees with DBH > 5 cm and three tree height (H) measurements were taken per sub plot. 
						Each tree species was recorded. 
						For all forest types except Mangroves, the carbon stock for each plot was calculated based on the measured DBH, the H simulated with H-DBH relationships and wood densities associated with the species. 
						<br/><br/>
						Allometric equations developed at national level in Viet Nam are used to estimate the carbon of each tree in Evergreen  broadleaf, Deciduous and Bamboo forests. 
						For Plantation and Coniferous trees and forests, volume equations were applied and wood densities used to convert volume to biomass. For other forest types excluding Mangroves, the equations for Evergreen broadleaf forests were used. 
						The tree carbon stock were summed at each subplot and average carbon stocks per ha were calculated per forest type and eco-region. 
						The carbon stock estimates of Mangrove forests are from literature review, applying weighted carbon stock averages for the main species present in the North and Central regions and for the South of Viet Nam.
						<br/><br/>
						The emission and removal factors were calculated as of difference of carbon stock resulting from the change between two forest types and can be recalculated easily from the carbon stock estimates provided. 
						Non-forest types are calculated at 0 carbon stock. For the conversion of natural forest to plantations, the emission factor was calculated as the total loss of forest (i.e. equivalent to a deforestation event). 
						This rule was defined both the Forest reference emission level/Forest reference level (FREL/FRL), and for the results.
